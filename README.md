# About Me

I'm a **Solutions Architect** specializing in cloud infrastructure design.
I help customers transform their ideas into scalable and secure cloud solutions by listening to their needs and recommending optimal architectures.
My passion lies in automation - from Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to CI/CD pipelines and GitOps - anything that makes fellow developers' lives easier and more productive.

With experties spanning AWS, NCP, Node.js, Go, and modern DevOps practices, I focus on building systems that are not only robust but also developer-friendly.
I believe the best infrastructure is the one developers don't have to think about.

**Key Focus Areas**
- üèóÔ∏è Cloud Infrastructure Design & Architecture
- üîÑ DevOps & GitOps Engineering
- üöÄ Developer Experience (DX) Optimization
- ‚ö° Automation & CI/CD Pipelines
